Welcome to my first Firebase blog post for INTP 362. My three blogs will be going into more detail on Cloud Firestore, setting it up, and seeing it in action. Today, I will be giving an overview on Cloud Firestore, and how NoSQL works in comparison to traditional SQL that we are familiar with already.


## What is Cloud Firestore?
Cloud Firestore is the newest database offered on Firebase (Google Cloud) that makes web, mobile and server development very flexible and scalable. It is available using Node.js, Java, Python, C++, and Unity. Using the NoSQL data model, the developer is able to store data in a format similar to JSON using not only traditional data types such as Strings and Integers, but also Arrays, Maps, and References. Firestore is able to organize many different types of data and make it available to the user very efficiently.
