Welcome to my first Firebase blog post for INTP 362. My three blogs will be going into more detail on Cloud Firestore, setting it up, and seeing it in action. Today, I will be giving an overview on Cloud Firestore, and how NoSQL works in comparison to traditional SQL that we are familiar with already.


## What is Cloud Firestore?
Cloud Firestore is the newest database offered on Firebase (Google Cloud) that makes web, mobile and server development very flexible and scalable. It is available using Node.js, Java, Python, C++, and Unity. Using the NoSQL data model, the developer is able to store data in a format similar to JSON using not only traditional data types such as Strings and Integers, but also Arrays, Maps, and References. Firestore is able to organize many different types of data and make it available to the user very efficiently.

## How NoSQL Works - Queries
As stated above, NoSQL is structured very similarily to JSON. A document is a unit of storage that contains fields and values, represented by a name. It is similar to a row in SQL. Documents are put into collections, which is like a table. For example, one person in a Users table would be one document in a collection. The great thing about NoSQL is that not all documents have to have the same fields as each other. It is simply a reference to a location of data. Additionally, it is recommended to put same fields of data in multiple places to make it easier to retrieve in the future.

To retrieve this information in SQL, a query might look like this:  

`select first,last,born from users where username='alovelace';`
  
In Firestore, there are many languages/libraries that are supported. However, I will be using Node.js to display the queries.  

`let alovelaceDocumentRef = db.collection('users').doc('alovelace');`

The various fields from "alovelace" can then be accessed by using `alovelaceDocumentRef.first`, for example.

To make it even more complicated, you can have collections within documents. The Firebase documentation gives an example of a chatroom.

The data from "message1" can be accessed by the following Node.js query:  

`let messageRef = db.collection('rooms').doc('roomA').collection('messages').doc('message1');`  

To access from, simple use `messageRef.from`

Although it looks complicated, it is very straight forward! Subcollections allows the developer to be flexible and not have to make major database changes if the data is expected to expand over time. 

## How NoSQL Works - Adding Data
The first step to adding data to the database is to collect it first. 

`const { name, email, password, password2 } = req.body;`

In this example, the various data fields for a registration form is being collected from a POST request. After all validations (check if user is existing, passwords match, etc), the data is added to a User model.

`  const newUser = new User({
     name, email, password
   });`

The data is then added to the database

`let setDoc = db.collection('users').doc(name).set(newUser);`

In this example, we are creating a new document based on the users name inside the 'users' collection. Unlike SQL, this will create the doc if it doesn't exist, or overwrite the data if it does.

## How NoSQL Works - Deleting Data
Deleting data from the database is as simple as getting the collection or doc and calling .delete().  
`let deleteDoc = db.collection('users').doc('name').delete();`

However, there is one downside (and possible upside, depending on how you look at it) when it comes to deleting data in Firestore. If a document is deleted, it's subcollections are still available. In other words, deleting /collection/doc still allows you to visit /collection/doc/collection2. Because of this, it is important to have scripts that will go in and automatically delete all subcollections if you want to completely remove all documents and it's subdocuments. 

## Conclusion
Although we have not learned NoSQL, it is very simple and straight forward to use. There are no constraint violations like in SQL, and it is very flexible for your needs. Next time you need a database for your project, consider a NoSQL database!
